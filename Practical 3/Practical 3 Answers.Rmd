# Section 2
Import the data
```{r}
getwd()
setwd("/Users/carlaleone/Desktop/Exeter/Practical 3")
tl.data <- read.table("rsbl20170434_si_002.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ",", 
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(tl.data)
```

Finding the sample size for each roe deer population for which we have telomere length data.
```{r}
table(tl.data$Population)
# males and females per pop
table(tl.data$Sex, tl.data$Population)

#3.1 m and f per age class
table(tl.data$Sex, tl.data$Age, tl.data$Population)


```

## Descriptive Stats
aggregate tool for obtaining some stats
```{r}
aggregate(tl.data$BodyMass, by=list(tl.data$Population), mean)
# can use the output for more calcs
mean.bm.age <- aggregate(tl.data$BodyMass, by=list(tl.data$Age), mean)
mean.bm.age
# fix column names
colnames(mean.bm.age) <- c("Age", "MeanBodyMass")
head(mean.bm.age)

# other functions with aggregate()
sd.bm.age <- aggregate(tl.data$BodyMass, by=list(tl.data$Age), sd)
colnames(sd.bm.age) <- c("Age", "SdBodyMass")
head(sd.bm.age)
```
combine mean.bm.age and sd.bm.age into a single data frame. In this case, as both data frames are the same size and in the same order, we can simply take sd.bm.age$SdBodyMass and add it to mean.bm.age:
```{r}
mean.bm.age$SdBodyMass <- sd.bm.age$SdBodyMass
head(mean.bm.age)
```

## Missing data
```{r}
summary(tl.data)
#no missing data 
```
our data is not missing anything, but example in case we had to deal with it at any point byt adding a Body Mass column that is missing data:
```{r}
tl.data$BodyMass2 <- tl.data$BodyMass
tl.data$BodyMass2[sample(nrow(tl.data), 5)] <- NA
summary(tl.data$BodyMass2)

```

### Excercise 3.2
Explore sample () function and create a new variable RandomAge and calculate the mean body mass for each level of RandomAge. Compare these to the mean body mass per age class calculated above. What does this difference suggest with respect to the effect of age on body mass?
```{r}
?sample()
age<- c(1:13)
tl.data$SampleAge<- sample(age, nrow(tl.data), replace = TRUE)
View(tl.data)
sample.age.mean<- aggregate(tl.data$BodyMass, by=list(tl.data$SampleAge), mean)
sample.age.mean
mean.bm.age
```

Back to NAs
```{r}
mean(tl.data$BodyMass2[is.na(tl.data$BodyMass2)==FALSE])
# calculating the mean

mean(na.omit(tl.data$BodyMass2))

mean(tl.data$BodyMass2, na.rm = TRUE)


```
However, be careful when using na.omit(): When applied to a complete data frame (and not a single column as we did above), it will remove all records with NAs, also if the NA’s are located in a variable that is not relevant to your analysis.

Also,when we try to subset on the basis of variable that contains NA’s, R will retain the missing values:
```{r}
tl.data$BodyMass2[tl.data$BodyMass2 > 26]
length(tl.data$BodyMass2[tl.data$BodyMass2 > 26])
# need to remove NAs
length(tl.data$BodyMass2[is.na(tl.data$BodyMass2)==FALSE & tl.data$BodyMass2 > 26])
# can also use NA omit again
length(tl.data$BodyMass2[na.omit(tl.data$BodyMass2) > 26])


```


# Does telomere length decline with age?
## Linear regression:
To test if telomeres get shorter with age, we need to do a regression of RTL against Age using lm(), but before we do this, let’s look at the distribution of both variables by plotting two histograms:
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(tl.data$Age)
hist(tl.data$RTL)
```
The linear model. To specify our linear model, we first specify the dependent variable (RTL), followed by a ~ and the predictor variable Age:
```{r}
lm(RTL ~ Age, data = tl.data)
summary(lm(RTL ~ Age, data = tl.data))

# next using an anova to see if the slope is significantly different from 0:
anova(lm(RTL ~ Age, data = tl.data))

```

# Model Diagnostics
Checking if meet the assumptions
```{r}
m.rtl.age <- lm(RTL ~ Age, data = tl.data)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(m.rtl.age)
```
extracting values from the Residuals vs Fitted plot:
```{r}
resid.m.rtl.age <- resid(m.rtl.age)
predict.m.rtl.age <- predict(m.rtl.age)
#use these values to plot a histogram of the residuals, which creates the QQ Plot
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
hist(resid.m.rtl.age)
plot(resid.m.rtl.age ~ predict.m.rtl.age)
qqnorm(resid.m.rtl.age)
qqline(resid.m.rtl.age)
```

# Plotting a regression
In a final step, we would like to visualise the (apparent lack of a) relationship between telomere length and age using a scatter plot of RTL against Age:
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(RTL ~ Age, data=tl.data)
plot(RTL ~ Age, data=tl.data, cex.lab=1.2, col="grey", font.lab=2, pch=19, 
     xlim=c(0,14), ylim=c(0.5, 1.75), xlab="Age (years)", ylab="Relative telomere length")
abline(m.rtl.age, lty=2, lwd=1.5)
```


# Variation in body mass
## Effect of age on body mass
Just as we did for RTL, we can test whether BodyMass changes with age by performing a regression:
```{r}
m.bm.age <- lm(BodyMass ~ Age, data=tl.data)
summary(m.bm.age)
```

Excercise 3.6 = Plot reisduals vs fitted values, what does it suggest?
```{r}
resid.m.bm.age <- resid(m.bm.age)
predict.m.bm.age <- predict(m.bm.age)
plot(resid.m.bm.age ~ predict.m.bm.age)
```
It is unlikely that individuals continue to grow after a certain age, and hence we would expect a curvilinear effect of age on body mass. We can test this by including age as an additional quadratic term in our model:
```{r}
m.bm.age.2 <- lm(BodyMass ~ Age + I(Age^2), data=tl.data)
summary(m.bm.age.2)
#Note that to fit Age^2, we need to write I(Age^2).
#We should never rely solely on the output our linear model, but always visualise the relationship as well:
plot(BodyMass ~ Age, data=tl.data, cex.lab=1.2, col="grey", font.lab=2, pch=19, 
     xlab="Age (years)", ylab="Body mass")
```
This makes it immediately clear that the relationship between Age and BodyMass is not described very well by a straight line.

Unfortunately abline() does not allow us to plot polynomials, but of course we can plot the fitted values instead:
```{r}
age2.fitted <- predict(m.bm.age.2)
plot(age2.fitted ~ tl.data$Age)
# but to add to the initial plot...
plot(BodyMass ~ Age, data=tl.data, cex.lab=1.2, col="grey", font.lab=2, pch=19, 
     xlab="Age (years)", ylab="Body mass")
lines(age2.fitted ~ tl.data$Age)

# need to avoid all points being connected.So need to sort the x variable and the y (fitted) variable by the x variable. use sort() and order() functions.
plot(BodyMass ~ Age, data=tl.data, cex.lab=1.2, col="grey", font.lab=2, pch=19, 
     xlab="Age (years)", ylab="Body mass")
lines(age2.fitted[order(tl.data$Age)] ~ sort(tl.data$Age))
```

We can also fit Age as a categorical variable with 13 levels. Although this will result in the estimation of 12 rather than 2 parameters, it does not force the relationship with age to be a 2nd-order polynomial (i.e. a quadratic relationship). On the other hand, while it will tell us whether body mass varies among age classes, it does not tell us how body mass increases and/or decreases with age.

We fit a model similar to m.bm.full but Age is a factor:
```{r}
m.bm.age.factor <- lm(BodyMass ~ as.factor(Age), data = tl.data)
summary(m.bm.age.factor)
```
All 12 estimates for the effect of age are tested against the intercept (Age=0). But we need the full picture, so do an ANOVA that tests whether there is more variation among age classes than expected by chance.
```{r}
anova(m.bm.age.factor)

```
We would report this as: There is a significant effetc of age on body mass (𝐹12,126 =19.07, P < 0.001).

### Excercise 3.7
Looking at the plot, the main difference appears to be between individuals of age 1 and those that are older than 1. Test whether this is indeed the case.
```{r}
?ifelse()
class(tl.data$Age)
tl.data$Age<- as.numeric(tl.data$Age)
tl.data$age.class<- ifelse(tl.data$Age > 1,2,1)
tl.data$age.class<- as.factor(tl.data$age.class)
View(tl.data)

age.class.lm<- aov(BodyMass~age.class, data=tl.data)
summary(age.class.lm)
```
# Differences in body mass between populations
So far we have analysed data for both populations together. However, according to the authors, previous research has shown that both populations experience marked environmental differences. It would therefore be interesting to test if there is a difference in mean BodyMass between both populations. To this end, we again fit a linear model, but this time with Pop as a categorical predictor:
```{r}
m.bm.pop <- lm(BodyMass ~ Population, data=tl.data)
summary(m.bm.pop)
anova(m.bm.pop)
aggregate(tl.data$BodyMass, by=list(tl.data$Population), mean)
```

# Testing for age, population, and sex
It is not unlikely that body mass does not only differ between populations, but also between males and females, and between the different age classes. To test this, and to estimate the effect of each of these variables on body mass, we can fit a linear model that includes all of these variables as predictors:
```{r}
m.bm.full <- lm(BodyMass ~ Age + I(Age^2) + Population + Sex, data=tl.data)
summary(m.bm.full)
?predict
new_data <- data.frame(Age = 5, Population = "TF", Sex = "M")
predict.lm(m.bm.full, newdata = new_data)
```

Could use an anova:
```{r}
anova(m.bm.full)
```
The p-value for the Sex effect is identical to that obtained previously, this is not true for the others. This is because only the Sex effect is estimated while accounting for all the other effects.

### Excercise 3.1
Change the order of the effects in m.bm.full and see how this impacts the p-values provided by summary() and anova().
```{r}
m.bm.full.2 <- lm(BodyMass ~ Population + I(Age^2) + Sex + Age, data=tl.data)
anova(m.bm.full.2)
```

Instead, to test whether the inclusion of Population significantly improves the fit of the model, we fit a model without Population and compare it to m.bm.full:
```{r}
m.bm.no.pop <- lm(BodyMass ~ Age + I(Age^2) + Sex, data=tl.data)

anova(m.bm.no.pop, m.bm.full)

```
This has provided us with the significance of the difference in body mass between both populations, while accounting for all other effects in the model. Note that the p-value is identical to that obtained by the t-test reported by summary().

You now have all the information you need to report the population effect in a publication. For example, you could write something like: After accounting for the effects of age and sex, there was a statistically significant difference in body mass between the two study populations, with individuals in the TF population being 3.09 ± 0.46 kg heavier than individuals in the CH population (𝐹1,134
=45.1, P < 0.001).

### Excercise 3.11
Our full model (m.bm.full) did not include any interaction terms. Fit a model that includes all 2-way interactions and use model simplification to arrive at the Minimal Adequate Model (MAM).
```{r}
m1<- lm(BodyMass~ Age + Population + Sex + Age*Population + Age*Sex + Sex*Population, data = tl.data)
summary(m1)

minimal_model <- step(m1, direction = "backward")
summary(minimal_model)
#Lowest AIC is for the model BodyMass ~ Age + Population + Sex + Age*Sex

```

# Effect of age on telomere length, revisited
In section 3, we concluded that there was no evidence for an effect of age on telomere length. However, in section 4 we found strong evidence for differences between both populations in terms of body mass. It might therefore be worth looking at this relationship in both populations separately.

We can start with two separate regressions:
```{r}
summary(lm(RTL ~ Age, data=tl.data[tl.data$Pop=="CH",]))
# CH Population, negative estimate for age

summary(lm(RTL ~ Age, data=tl.data[tl.data$Pop=="TF",]))
# TF population, positive estimate for age

```

This is looking promising: Although in neither of the two populations the effect is significantly different from zero (although it is close in the TF population), the effects are going in opposite directions.

However, to formally test whether the effect of age differs between the two populations, we need to test whether the interaction between Age and Population is significant:
```{r}
m.age.pop.int <- lm(RTL ~ Age + Population + Age:Population, data=tl.data)
summary(m.age.pop.int)

#can also specify the model like this: 
m.age.pop.int <- lm(RTL ~ Age*Population, data=tl.data)

```

To test whether the interaction term is significant, we compare this model to a model that only includes the main effects of Age and Population:

```{r}
m.age.pop <- lm(RTL ~ Age + Population, data=tl.data)
anova(m.age.pop, m.age.pop.int)
```
To conclude, we would like to plot the this result. To do this, we first plot the results for one population, and then use points() to add the results for the other population in a different colour. Finally, we add use legend() to add a legend to the plot:
```{r}
plot(RTL ~ Age, data=tl.data[tl.data$Pop=="CH",], cex.lab=1.2, xlim=c(0,14), 
     ylim=c(0.5, 1.75), pch=19, col="red", font.lab=2, 
     xlab="Age (years)", ylab="Relative telomere length")

points(RTL ~ Age, data=tl.data[tl.data$Pop=="TF",], pch=19, col="blue")
abline(lm(RTL ~ Age, data=tl.data[tl.data$Pop=="CH",]), col="red", lwd=1.5)
abline(lm(RTL ~ Age, data=tl.data[tl.data$Pop=="TF",]), col="blue", lwd=1.5)

legend(x="topright", legend=c("CH", "TF"), pch=19, lty = 1, 
       col=c("red", "blue"), title="Population", cex=0.8)
```
