### Bioinformatics

For the first round of sequencing, the sequencing outputs (FASTQ Files) were uploaded to the MitoFish Pipeline. All the steps and processes completed by the MitFish pipeline are listed [here](https://mitofish.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/mifish/help/).
More information on the MitoFosh pipeline and any updates are also mentioned in the paper by [Zhu *et al*. (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/40/3/msad035/7037602?login=false).

- The BLASTN Identitiy was set to 98% and the sequencing alignment length was set to 229 ± 50 base pairs.


For the second round of sequencing (wells that were re-run due to positive control contamination), the sequencing outputs (FASTQ Files) were uploaded to the updated MitoFish Pipeline (MitoNGS). Information on the MitoNGS Pipeline can be found [here](https://mitofish.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/mito-ngs/help).

- The BLASTN Identity was set to 98% and the min ASV abundance was 0.1%
