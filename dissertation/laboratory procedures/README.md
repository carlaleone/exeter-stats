## Lab Procedures
This folder contains the lab procedures that were used for DNA extractions and Qubit Assays. 

### Extractions
- Protocol follows procedures outlined by [Maiello et al. Little samplers, big fleet: eDNA metabarcoding from commercial trawlers enhances ocean monitoring 2022. Fisheries Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783622000364). And as used in Kressler, Whitelegg et al. In Review. Environmental DNA.
- Some slight modifications were made according to the steps used for this research, and the full updated protocol can be found in [this pdf](https://github.com/carlaleone/exeter-stats/blob/main/dissertation/laboratory%20procedures/Gauze_filter_DNAextraction_2025_LeoneEdits.pdf).
- The buffers and reagents used in this extraction are all from the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit. 


### Qubit Assays
- Protocol for Qubit Assays to get DNA Yield results was used from procedures outlined in [this pdf](https://github.com/carlaleone/exeter-stats/blob/main/dissertation/laboratory%20procedures/QubitProtocol_Kressler2025.pdf)
- Qubit dsDNA HS was used, as our samples have very low concentrations of DNA, requiring high sensitivity. 


### PCR and Sequencing
- All samples were sent to Exeter Sequencing for PCR and sequencing with the MiFish U/E Primers. The protocl used by Exeter sequencing can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://github.com/carlaleone/exeter-stats/blob/main/dissertation/laboratory%20procedures/SeqMethodChecklist_11738___11569_MiFish_SOP_Joint_-_bW___GM_plate1_16_06_2025.xlsx)
